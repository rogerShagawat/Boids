This is a little visualizer I made simulating boids using processing which is a library for javascript which makes displaying visuals much easier.
Boids are a simulation of flocking patterns in birds developed by Craig Reynolds, I took an interest in it a few years ago and took my own shot at re-creating the simulation.
If you'd like to read more about Boids I would recommend the [Wikipedia Article on Boids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids)
As well as the [Sebastian Lague video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqtqltqcQhw) where he uses a 3D implementation to simulate schools of fish!
